* part 1: JS

The whole output of this code will be written to the console, line by line, after 5 seconds.</b> 
Explanation: the iteration of the for loop execute immediately for all the elements of the array, and then wait for 5 sec to actually execute the functions within the setTimeout method.</br>
If we want the console to log every five seconds about another element, we should use the setInterval method, or simply multiply the delay argument, in the setTimeout, by the "i" variable.
