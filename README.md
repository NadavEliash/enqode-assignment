* part 1: JS

The whole output of this code will be written to the console, line by line, after 5 seconds. The iteration of the for loop execute immediately for all the elements of the array, and then wait for 5 sec to actually execute the function within the setTimeout method.
If we want the console to log every five seconds about another element, we should use the setInterval method, or simply multiply the delay argument by the "i" variable.
